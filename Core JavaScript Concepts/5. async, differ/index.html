    <!-- If we don't use any attribute (async or defer) then browser will follow below steps  -->
    <!-- 
        1. Do parsing of html untill it finds a script tag
        2. After getting the script tag -> first it will get script file from netword and then
            will execute script file.
        3. In step 2, parsing of html will be stoped 
        4. Now completion of step 2, it will continue the html parsing till the new script tag found 
        5. Repet the same steps  
    -->

    <script src="./index2.js" async></script>
    <!-- async attribute: when we use async then browser will load script file concurrently while parsing html,
        after getting the script file then browser will stop parsing html and will execute script,
        when script execution finish then browser will continue for the parsing of remaining html  -->

    <script src="./index3.js" defer></script>
    <!-- defer attribute: when we use defer then browser will load script file concurrently while parsing html,
        and finish the parsing of html then it will execute the script but while parsing the html it will only 
        get the script from netword but will not execute it. Execution of script only happens when parsing of 
        html finishes. -->
