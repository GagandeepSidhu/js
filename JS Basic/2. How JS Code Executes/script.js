/*

Note: Even before the program starts executing, memory is allocated to every variables and functions and
variables initialize with undefined and functions initialize with actual function code. 

When a program executes then a Execution Context created and it has two phases:
1. Memory creation: In this phase memory is given to the variables and functions.Variables are initialize with
undefined and functions are initialize with the actual function code.


2. Code Execution: In this phase code will be executes line by line and value of variables will be change
according to the code statements.
   
Note: When a function invoked/called then a new Execution Context will be created and will be inserted to the 
call stack. This new Execution Context will also have two phases similar to the above.
