1. npm i -g babel-cli@6.26.0    //after @, it is version no. 
2. npm install babel-preset-env@1.6.1                                                          
3. Create a file ex: input.js
4. Write some code
5. npm init  
6. Compile it using babel:  babel input.js -o output.js --presets env  //it will create output.js 
                                                         //automaticall with simplified js code for old browsers

7. Add src and public/scripts folder 
8. create file index.js inside src folder 
9. add srcipt in package.json file: 
    babel ./src/index.js -o ./public/scripts/index-min.js --presets env --watch

    note:
    make sure these libraries should be installed locally :
    live-server  : it is to use watch for running the app in browser 
    --watch for live server, it will look for changes the update accordingly

webpack: it is used to create a single bundeled file for all js modules. We can use export and import keywords.
It will take all modules and compile in a single file.

configuration:    
10. npm i webpack@4.5.0 webpack-cli@2.0.0
11. create script inside package.json file:
    "webpack": "webpack"   
    when we run: npm run webpack -> it takes the file webpack.config.js and will crete compiled file accordingly
12. create configuration file: webpack.config.js
13. intigrate babel with webpack: 
    npm i babel-loader
    make change to webpack.config.js

14. webpack-dev-server :
    it is word same is live-server (with option --watch in script commands)
    but it has it's own advantages
    1. npm i webpack-dev-server
    2. configure webpack.config.js file:
        devServer: {
            contentBase: path.resolve(__dirname, 'public'),
            publicPath: '/scripts/'
        }
    3. add new command in scripts of package.json file:
        "dev-server": "webpack serve"


15. To use spread operator for objects
    1. npm i babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread
    2. configure webpack.config.js file:
        add in option for babel:- plugins: ['transform-object-rest-spread'],        

16. npm i babel-polyfill
    webpack.confin.js:
    entry: ['babel-polyfill', '/src/index.js'],

*. to uninstall something: nmp uninstall package-name
